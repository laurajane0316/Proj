                    <img src ="Bibingkang-Lalaki-700x878.jpg"><br><br>

                        Bibingkang Lalaki is also referred to as Bibingkang Boac, named after the province’s capital. It’s a huge portion of bibingka; that’s the size of a pizza.<br>

                        Locals will explain amusedly that this version of bibingka is called as thus because it contains eggs. Bibingkang lalaki also uses coconut wine instead of yeast, which keeps its inside moist after cooking.

                    <p>Another native version found in Marinduque can be bought in the town of Sta. Cruz is located on the northeastern coast of the island.<br>

                        Bibingkang Pinahiran uses typical bibingka ingredients like glutinous rice, coconut milk, and sugar. What makes it stand out from other versions of bibingka is the thick spread of a syrup layer on top.<br>

                        This likely is the origin of its name with pinahiran translating to coated. One serving of this sweet bibingkang pinahiran guarantees a heavy stomach.
